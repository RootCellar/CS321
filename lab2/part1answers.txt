1. what does the program print, and in what order?

The program outputs the following:

waiting...
^C received an interrupt signal through Ctrl-C.
Going to sleep.
 Notice the process is not exiting immediately
Out of here.
Now the process will terminate with the exit system call

2. describe exactly what is happening to produce the answer observed for the above
question

sighandler() is set as the signal handler for the SIGINT signal. when Control+C are pressed, SIGINT is sent,
and sigHandler(SIGINT) is called, which prints "Notice the process is not exiting immediately", waits one
second, then prints the rest of the statements before terminating.
